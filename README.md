# 🌟 anja-ui

**anja-ui** is a modern, type-safe React component library and design system.  
It’s built with [React 19](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [class-variance-authority](https://cva.style/).  
Every component is accessible by default and comes with variants powered by **CVA** for consistent styling.


## ✨ Features

- ⚛️ **React 19 + TypeScript** – strongly typed props and polymorphic components.
- 🎨 **Tailwind 4 + CSS variables** – theming built on design tokens.
- ⚡ **Vite + Storybook 9** – instant playground with live docs.
- 🧩 **Headless UI (optional)** – accessible primitives integrated where it makes sense.
- 🛠️ **Tree-shakable** – import only what you need.
- 📦 **ESM + CJS** – works in all bundlers.
